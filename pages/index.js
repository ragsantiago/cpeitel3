and online game. My favourite music are green tea and honey and songs by jeff bernat and
Keenan Te. Favorite food is any kind of seafood and vegetables. And I am a bisexual, and
introvert person, I like being alone most of the time I like to spend my time alone rather than
being outside. Most of the time I am watching some movies or youtube or playing online
games.
